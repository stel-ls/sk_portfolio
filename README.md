### Personal Projects

As a sophomore beginning my  journey into the vast field of data science, I have created this page to showcase a few personal projects I have been working on to develop my skills with real world data.

## Netflix Visualizations -- R

I had self-studied some data cleaning as well as basic data manipulation and visualization in R. Using a dataset I found on Kaggle, I sought to apply the skills I learned to real data. I outlined my thought process as well as my analysis on how the visualizations could be interpreted in the document linked below.

## Coffee Sales Dashboard -- Excel

After taking an Excel series online, I found a sales dataset tutorial and tested it out onto this coffee data to create an interactive dashboard.

## Apartment Prices Visualization and Modelling

In this group project, I webscraped data of apartment listings near UCLA from apartments.com using ParseHub, cleaned the data in R, and visualized some insights with Tableau. 
Attached below is our final project which we presented at the NSDC Fall 2023 Showcase as well as the R code I used to clean the data (with notes) and the final dataset we used in our analysis.

### Completed Tutorials

## Urban Heat Island Indicators Dashboard

I created an interactive dashboard showing several heat island indicators in Richmond Virginia in an ArcGIS tutorial. The map is made up of multiple layers, which have been analyzed per census block group.
