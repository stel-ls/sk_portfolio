### Personal Projects

As a sophomore beginning my  journey into the vast field of data science, I have created this page to showcase a few personal projects I have been working on to develop my skills with real world data.

## Netflix Visualizations -- R

I had self-studied some data cleaning as well as basic data manipulation and visualization in R. Using a dataset I found on Kaggle, I sought to apply the skills I learned to real data. I outlined my thought process as well as my analysis on how the visualizations could be interpreted in the document linked below.

## Coffee Sales Dashboard -- Excel

After taking an Excel series online, I found a sales dataset tutorial and tested it out onto this coffee data to create an interactive dashboard.

## Apartment Prices Visualization and Modelling

In this group project, I webscraped data of apartment listings near UCLA from apartments.com using ParseHub, cleaned the data in R, and visualized some insights with Tableau.
