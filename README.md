### SCBGP Dashboard for the Local and Regional Foods Division at USDA

I worked at the USDA as a Data Analyst Fellow in the summer of 2024, creating an automated data flow to clean and transform funding data from the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program (SCBGP) database to a live dashboard. This project supported internal team decision-making by centralizing access to accurate data and new insights. She also helped build an R Shiny dashboard to identify noncompetitive funding gaps for the 2024 USDA Tech Hackathon and created visualizations for various Local and Regional Foods Division (LRFD) teams to be used in public infographics and reports.

# School Projects

### Apartment Prices Visualization and Modelling

In this group project, I webscraped data of apartment listings near UCLA from apartments.com using ParseHub, cleaned the data in R, and visualized some insights with Tableau. 
Attached below is our final project which we presented at the NSDC Fall 2023 Showcase as well as the R code I used to clean the data (with notes) and the final dataset we used in our analysis.

### Flight Delays Visualizations

I primarily visualized insights on millions of domestic US flight delays between the years 2019-2023 with an emphasis on pre and post COVID impacts. I also broke down flight delays by the day of the week and airline carrier.

### Effect of Racquet Specifications on Tennis Performance

As Data Journalist on the Bruin Sports Analytics team, my partner and I analyzed the impact that racquet specifications had on certain aspects of tennis performance. These analyses were applied to several professional players, with a focus on the impact upon their playing styles.

# Personal Projects

### Netflix Visualizations -- R 

I had self-studied some data cleaning as well as basic data manipulation and visualization in R. Using a dataset I found on Kaggle, I sought to apply the skills I learned to real data. I outlined my thought process as well as my analysis on how the visualizations could be interpreted in the document linked below.

### Coffee Sales Dashboard -- Excel (Tutorial-Based)

After taking an Excel series online, I found a sales dataset tutorial and tested it out onto this coffee data to create an interactive dashboard.

### Urban Heat Island Indicators Dashboard (Tutorial-Based)

I created an interactive dashboard showing several heat island indicators in Richmond Virginia in an ArcGIS tutorial. The map is made up of multiple layers, which have been analyzed per census block group.
